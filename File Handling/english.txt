Presently, people say that money is everything, money buys happiness. However, money do buys happiness and fulfill their needs for most of the people in the world. The reason for my opinion towards topic statement can be explained in the upcoming paragraph.

Firstly, Money can provide multiple reasons to make a person happy in life. It can buy people big mansions and luxury amenities that is the dream of most of the population in the world. It can give multiple foreign trips annually, make people go out clubbing every two-three times a week, it can fill their wardrobes with luxury Clothing and Cosmetics, even fill their Safes with gold, platinum and diamond ornaments. Like a person going to international trip every two times in a month.  

Secondly, Money is not everything that people needs. In life, happiness is what every single person in the world demands. It is not directly proportional to money. The time spending with our loved ones, go out chill with them and plan TV shows and movies together is I think more worth than being anxious about money. For example, a weekly gathering of neighbours, family, relative or friends etc.   

In Conclusion, I would say that money is not everything, some can buy big luxury homes and amenities but what if he or she has family problems, problem relating to finance or anything which money can't resolve. Therefore, happiness is worth more than money. Being socaily active, a healthy lifestyle and organised daytime activities is more than enough to make a person happy in life.
